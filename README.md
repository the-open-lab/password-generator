# A truly random password generator

Most, if not all, password generators are built on their core language's [random number generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator) algorithms, which necessarily are always limited to [pseudorandomness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandomness) as opposed to producing truly random results. A popular web service that provides actual random numbers is [RANDOM.org](https://www.random.org/), and they do, indeed, have a [secure password generation service](https://www.random.org/passwords/). However, password requirements often are more strict than what that service provides. For example, the passwords generated by it never have non-alphanumeric characters, sometimes referred to as "[special characters](https://owasp.org/www-community/password-special-characters)", and this is quite often a requirement. Hence, this project was born.

## _Modus Operandi_

This project makes use of the RANDOM.org API in order to obtain truly random bytes from which to create the resulting password, and then filters this result in a "sieve" to produce an output of only those characters in the alphanumeric and special characters sets &ndash; collectively referred to here as "password characters". These characters are those which are able to be typed from an English-language keyboard. From this set of candidate characters, the resulting password is created from the substring beginning with the first character until the _n_<small><sup>th</sup></small> character, where _n_ is the required password length.
